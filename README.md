## 🌐 Overview

This project uses deep learning algorithms to automate and optimize the quality inspection process of sticker applications on car body holes. Specifically, it identifies whether the holes are open, closed, or partially closed across various environmental conditions.

## ✨ Features

- **Robust Identification**: Trained to recognize open, closed, and partially closed cases, accommodating different colored parts, lighting conditions, and angular positions.
- **High Confidence**: Algorithms ensure reliable results in every environment with high confidence values.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Ultralytics YOLO
- Roboflow API
